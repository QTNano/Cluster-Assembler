# `Cluster-Assembler`

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/520031576.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/520031576)

This package can be used to generate atomistic structures for metallic complexes that model the strutures presents in living libraries.
This is done via a commbination of DFT ab-initio calculations and data science techniques.

## Recomendations
Before running the code, the user should check the following:

1. The directory where you plan to run the workflow should be set up with the following files/folder:
 - `main.py`, the main python script to execute the workflow.
 - `mol.txt`, simple list of atomic numbers and simbles, used in the code. Can be adapted by the user if specific labels are used instead of traditional atomic species (e.g., `O1, O2, O3, ...` is used to represent diferet parametrizations for oxigen). This file MOST be in the same folder as the `main.py`
 - `core/`, folder containing the core code of the toolbox
 - `parameters.json`, input file for the workflow.

2. We strongly encourage the use of [`Anaconda`](https://anaconda.org/).

## Installation

This tool utilizes Anaconda to set up a virtual environment where all required dependencies are managed, although the system can also be configured manually.

To begin, clone or download this repository and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your specific operating system. Once installed, navigate to the root directory of this repository using your terminal and execute the following command:

```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Executing this command will generate a new Anaconda virtual environment equipped with all the dependencies needed to run the Cluster-Assembler toolbox.

## Execution

### Starting conda

To execute the toolbox, start by activating the `py396` Anaconda environment:
```shell
$ conda activate py396
```
Next, launch the program with Python:
```shell
$ python3 main.py parameters.json
```

The `parameters.json` contains all parameters for the execution. This file is explained next.

---

### Toolbox parameters

The file `parameters.json` has to be set-up for each specific use case. This is done by changing the parameters according to the tasks that `Cluster-Assember` will perform. Here, a reference guide for the meaning of each input field in this file:

**Main settings** 

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default Value |
|--|--|--|--|
| `MODULES` | list of integers | Select which module (or modules) will be run | `[1, 2, 3]`|

**MOD1 - Module 1 - Frame Family**
| Parameter | Type | Description | Default Value |
|--|--|--|--|
| `INTEGRITY` | float | Define the tolerance regarding the covalent radius allowed to form a structure, e.g., when set to 1, the covalent radius of the species is the limit to form a link.
 | `1.5`|
| `NUMGEN` | integer | Number of generated frames | `100`|
| `RADIUS_FACTOR` | float | Parameter that controls the size of the box/sphere | `0.5`|

| `LIGANDS_DISTRIBUTION` | list of integers | Define the ligands and their quantities to generate the complexes. The first number indicates the number of times that ligand 1 will be added, the second number the second ligand, and so on. The ligands are selected by alphabetical order of files in the folder informed in `LIGANDS_FOLDER`  | `[3,2]`|
| `LIGANDS_ORIENTATION` | list of lists | Ligands orientation: sample value: [-1] for random, [0 or 1] for diatomic molecules, [1,2,3] for selecting the atoms 1, 2 and 3 for orienting the ligant | `[[-1], [0,1,2]]`|
| `N_SAMPLES` | integer | Number of complexes that will be generated for each input core | `100`|
| `N_CORES` | integer | Number of cores that will be used in the simulation. If the number of cores are superior to the number of files presented in `CORES_FOLDER`, the number of existant files will be used | `3`|
| `LIGANDS_DISTANCE` | float | Distance between the ligand and the core | `2.25`|
| `CORES_FOLDER` | string | Folder containing the cores (XYZ) files | `./cores`|
| `LIGANDS_FOLDER` | string | Folder containing the ligands (XYZ) files | `./ligands`|


We recommend that inexperienced users keep advanced parameters set to their `default` values. However, all parameters can be adjusted as needed. 

## Modules
<!-- <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <div style="flex: 2; padding: 0px;"> -->

### Module 0 - MOD0
This module is a *k*-means clustering tool to select the representatives unary cores, binary cores, and complexes. This module uses the eigenvalues of the Coulomb matrix of the provided structures to select a set of representative ones.


### Module 1 - MOD1.
In this module, unary cores are generated, processed, analyzed, and clustered. We included a series of user options that allow combining external sourcing and internally generating the unary cores as needed by the case of study. The cores are checked according to a integrity filter (covalent radius) and clustered by *k*-means if the `RUN_MOD_ZERO` flag is activated.

### Module 2 - MOD2.
Here, permutations (i.e., all possible or user-specified) are performed in the atomic species of each of the selected unary cores. The binary cores are subsequently checked for integrity and clustered by *k*-means if the `RUN_MOD_ZERO` flag is activated.

### Module 3 - MOD3.
Module responsable to distribute the ligands around the selected binary cores. The ligands XYZ are imported from `ligands/` folder. Several ligands might be used in the process. Their orientation regarding the core is controled by the user, which can select a random  or specific orientation (provided by a set of base atoms). An overlap filter iteratively excludes structures with overlapping atoms (integrity). The default threshold is set to t=`1.25`, and can be manually tuned. The filtered complexes are again clustered by *k*-means if the `RUN_MOD_ZERO` flag is activated. Finally, the selected structures are the representatives within the living library family of structures, and can be externally optimized using methods such as Density Functional Theory.

*NOTE:* Energy calculations must be done externally and can be automated using appropriate quantum chemistry software such as FHI-aims, CREST, VASP, or ADF.

## Example

### Sample inputs and outputs

We provided a ZIP file (Example_Cu8Al6Cps6) with a main folder that contains the cluster_assembler code and all related files and folders, the input, and the outputs for the test case of the \[Cu<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>\](Cp*)<sub>6</sub> complex. The folders are already named as the default values in main.py, i.e., /Mod01, /Mod02, and /Mod03 for Module 1, Module 2, and Module 3, respectively. You can directly execute the cluster_assembler code in that folder and follow the default options and the given parameters.json input to reproduce the data. The pre-generated frames were obtained from Cu<sub>14</sub> and Al<sub>14</sub> structures and can be found in /Mod01, while the binary Cu<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub> cores are found in /Mod02.

### Example Running

For generating the binary cores, the maximum number of permutations was taken into account and Mod0 was used ([200,300,10]) to obtain the representative ones (k=200). They were optimized with DFT at a light level, and the optimized structures are available in /Cu8Al6_structures_optimized. The Cp* ligands were previously rearranged and oriented ([0,1,2]) around the 197 binary cores within a distance of 2.5 Ã…. The number of configurations set was 10250 to achieve ~2 million trial structures that were filtered and further reduced to 300 with Mod0 (k=300). All other parameters were set to default values. The initial trial structures are found in /Mod03, while the optimized ones with DFT at the light level are available in /Cu8Al6Cps6_structures_optimized.

After DFT, the family of \[Cu<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>\](Cp*)<sub>6</sub> complexes was carefully evaluated, and Mod0 was used to reduce to the 15 representative \[Cu<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>\](Cp*)<sub>6</sub> complexes depicted in the available figure.

The code was originally tested on an Ubuntu 22.04.03 system but should be compatible with any Linux distribution. The time-consuming part of the workflow is the quantum chemistry calculation, which is related to the cluster nature, HPC facilities, and the used quantum chemistry program package. All DFT calculations were performed with the FHI-aims program at the PBE-TS-vdw/light-tier1 level.
